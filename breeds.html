                <p class="breed-desc">
                    Originating from Gujarat's Gir Forest region, the Gir cow stands out with its
                    striking appearance, characterized by a large hump, long ears, and a convex forehead.
                    Renowned for its productivity, it yields an impressive 6â€“10 liters of milk per day.
                    <span class="more-text" style="display: none;">
                        Beyond its high milk yield, the Gir cow's adaptability to diverse climatic conditions
                        and resistance to diseases and parasites make it a prized breed in the dairy industry.
                        Moreover, it plays a crucial role in developing other cattle breeds.

                <p class="breed-desc">
                    The Hariana cow, native to Haryana and also found in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar, is of medium
                    size, featuring a white or light grey coat with a black switch on the tail.
                    <span class="more-text" style="display: none;">
                        Its long, narrow face and flat forehead, along with short, stumpy horns and a small hump, are
                        distinctive attributes. Serving as a dual-purpose breed, it yields an average of 4-6 liters of
                        milk per day and contributes to agricultural tasks such as ploughing and carting. Its tolerance
                        to extreme temperatures and ability to thrive on low-quality feed further enhance its appeal for
                        dairy farming.

                        making it an ideal choice for agricultural tasks such as ploughing and carting. Furthermore, its
                        adaptability to various climates and terrains enhances its utility in diverse agricultural
                        settings, underlining its importance in rural economies.

                        American Brown Swiss.
