        <p>What actually happened to the Indian cow breeds that today they need to be improvised? The story dates back
            to the times when European invaders eyed the invaluable attributes of Indigenous breeds of cattle. With the
            advent of East India Company started the export of superior quality Indian Cows as well as Bulls from India.
            Indian farmers were misguided to abscond their cows on the roads by spreading the air that they yield less
            milk. Subsequently, Indian farmer adopted foreign exotic breeds while the foreigners started rearing Indian
            germ plasm.

            In 1960 Brazil imported three cattle breeds from India – Gir, Kankrej and Ongole; and today, Brazil has
            emerged as the world’s biggest exporter of improved cattle embryos and semen of bulls of Indian breeds. It
            is ironical that today in India such pure breeds are hard to find. Over the years, indigenous breeds on the
            roads have been subjected to indiscriminate breeding with bulls of foreign breeds. As a result, what we see
            today in numbers is mostly cross breeds of the two. So what, someone may question? The situation is grave.
            Heavy expenses incurring in maintenance of exotic breeds, dearth of cow dung as natural fertilizer, lack of
            suitable livestock for draught purposes and intake of A1 beta-casein in exotic cow’s milk are all together
            making a toll not just in the house of Indian farmer but on the overall Indian agriculture as well as the
            national economy.</p>
